Price Monitoring using import.io
================

Monitor competitor prices (and other data) using import.io

amazon_tablet_prices.py will do all the work, just execute it by typing 

    python amazon_tablet_prices.py 

in you command line / terminal.


You only need python installed (http://www.python.org/) and the next dependancies:
- Requests library (http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- 

----------------------

Note: If you are more technical, I recommend you to try import.io client libraries, using the CometD API: https://github.com/import-io/importio-client-libs
